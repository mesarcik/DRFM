	\begin{enumerate}
		\item I know that plagiarism means taking and using the ideas, writings, works
		or inventions of another as if they were one’s own. I know that plagiarism
		not only includes verbatim copying, but also the extensive use of another
		person’s ideas without proper acknowledgement (which includes the
		proper use of quotation marks). I know that plagiarism covers this sort of
		use of material found in textual sources and from the Internet. 
		\item I acknowledge and understand that plagiarism is wrong. 
		\item I understand that my research must be accurately referenced. I have
		followed the rules and conventions concerning referencing, citation and the
		use of quotations as set out in the Departmental Guide. 
		\item This assignment is my own work, or my group’s own unique group
		assignment. I acknowledge that copying someone else’s assignment, or part
		of it, is wrong, and that submitting identical work to others constitutes a
		form of plagiarism. 
		\item I have not allowed, nor will I in the future allow, anyone to copy my work
		with the intention of passing it off as their own work.

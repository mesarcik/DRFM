# DRFM
Digital Radio Frequency Memory
## About
Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) is a technique used to record an incoming Radio Frequency (RF) signal, in turn applying a series of time-delays, amplitude scalings and frequency shifts and retransmitting the signal. This technique is used widely in the electronic defense industry as a form of radar jamming, in that it allows for the synthesis of artificial targets. This project is a  design and implementation of a DRFM system on a low cost FPGA system.
## Hardware
This project makes use of the Terasic DE10-lite development board.
## Software Dependancies 
PyQt and Quartus Prime 16.1

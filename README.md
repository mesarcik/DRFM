# `DRFM`: Digital Radio Frequency Memory
A repository containing the implementation of the paper entitled [Low Cost FPGA based Implementation of a DRFM System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8835754) 

## About
Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) is a technique used to record an incoming Radio Frequency (RF) signal, in turn applying a series of time-delays, amplitude scalings and frequency shifts and retransmitting the signal. This technique is used widely in the electronic defense industry as a form of radar jamming, in that it allows for the synthesis of artificial targets. This project is a  design and implementation of a DRFM system on a low cost FPGA system.

## Hardware
This project makes use of the Terasic DE10-lite development board.

## Software Dependancies 
PyQt and Quartus Prime 16.1

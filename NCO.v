/* 	The NCO Module: The NCO is an oscillator that uses a look up table, an adder and a memory to output
	periodic waveforms. In this case, the periodic waveforms are sin and cos, as they are required to map
	the complex exponential frequency shift to a realisable model. The way the NCO worked was by receiving
	an input frequency word that was integrated to obtain a phase that could be addressed on a Look Up Table
	(LUT). The LUT was implemented through the use of a 4096 address long 16-bit wide dual port	ROM that
	was pre-initialized with a MATLAB generated Memory Initialization File (MIF). The MIF fileâ€™s contents
	was a 100Hz sinusoid that was sampled at 212Hz.
